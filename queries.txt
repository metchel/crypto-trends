Time-series charts (graphing performance of coins)

Bitcoin over all time
Bitcoin in April 2017 - April 2018
Bitcoin in November 1 2017 - Feb 1 2018

Bitcoin vs all other coins on these same intervals

Coins using pow/pos, pow, or pos vs coins using other proof types
Coins without proof types vs coins with proof types

Coins using sha256/sha512 (bitcoin algo) vs coins with other algos
Coins with scrypt (ether algo) vs coins with other algos
Coins with scrypt vs coins with sha256/512

could do some pie charts comparing the latter series too, to show proportions of coins using given proof types or algorithms

Trends (back to time-series):
bitcoin vs trends of blockchain
bitcoin vs trends of bitcoin

ether vs trends of ethereum
ether vs trends of ether
ether vs trends of bitcoin

xrp vs trends of ripple
xrp vs trends of xrp

all coins but bitcoin vs trends of bitcoin
all coins but ether vs trends of ethereum
all coins but xrp vs trends of ripple
